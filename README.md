# Find Your Hat

In this game, you play as on a field filled with holes and a single hat. Your goal is to navigate the field and reach the hat before falling into a hole or reaching the edge of the field.

To move around the field, use the W, A, S, and D keys to move up, left, down, and right, respectively. Be careful not to fall into a hole or go off the field, or you will lose the game. If you manage to reach the hat, you win!

The field is randomly generated each time you play, so no two games will be exactly the same. Can you reach the hat and emerge victorious?
